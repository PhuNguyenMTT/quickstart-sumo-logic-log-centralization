### Rapid deployment of AWS security best practices in minutes with Sumo Logic AWS Security QuickStart solution

Sumo Logic Cloud SIEM is introducing a new AWS quickstart solution with best practices, built-in content, queries, and dashboards to help customers to detect, investigate and respond to security threats and vulnerabilities. Sumo Logic AWS QuickStart solution helps customers get started instantly with a decade of best practices that we have learned with 2000+ customers.

For instance, customers use our AWS CloudTrail app to track user activity, the GuardDuty app for monitoring threat detection and the GuardDuty Benchmark app to understand how customerâ€™s security posture compares with the global benchmarks that we gather from hundreds of Sumo Logic customers. The VPC Flow Logs and the AWS WAF apps are used to monitor traffic patterns and the Threat Intel app for AWS is used to help detect threats in your environment with Sumo Logic Threat Intelligence, whereas the AWS apps for PCI and CIS Foundations are used to simplify audits and maintain compliance. 

Given that most customers use multiple security apps, we have created an AWS Security QuickStart solution that allows customers to automate: 
The collection of security events from AWS security services
The installation and configuration of over 11 Sumo Logic apps designed for AWS security

Once configured as described below, the automation takes less than 10 minutes. 

Customers can also roll-back the collection and Sumo Logic app installation if so desired.
