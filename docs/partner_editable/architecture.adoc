As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* Amazon GuardDuty to detect malicious activity and behavior to protect AWS accounts and workloads. 

* Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) Flow Logs to capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces. 

* AWS Security Hub to assess security alerts and security posture across AWS  accounts. Security Hub relays security events to Amazon CloudWatch.

* AWS WAF to protect your web applications from common web exploits. 

* AWS Config to record and evaluate configurations of your AWS resources. 

* AWS CloudTrail to track user activity and API (application programming interface) usage. 

* Amazon CloudWatch for relaying the VPC logs to the Lambda function.

* Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams to transfer logs from AWS WAF to S3 buckets.

* A Lambda function to create a collector and install apps.

* S3 buckets to capture logs from the various services. 

* Sumo Logic collector and sources to receive logs from the S3 buckets. 

* Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), which is triggered by S3 bucket events.
