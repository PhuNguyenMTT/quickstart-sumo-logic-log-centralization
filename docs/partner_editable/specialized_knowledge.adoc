This Quick Start supports the following scenarios: 

* **Scenario 1: You do not use AWS security services or Sumo Logic.** You did not 
configure AWS to use one or more security services listed under <<Specialized knowledge>>, 
but you want to collect and analyze data using Sumo Logic apps. For this scenario, use 
this Quick Start to set up AWS security services and configure Sumo Logic. 

* **Scenario 2: You use AWS security services but not Sumo Logic.** You use the AWS security services listed under <<Specialized knowledge>> but have not configured Sumo 
Logic to collect data from AWS or installed the corresponding Sumo Logic apps. For this 
scenario, configure the auxiliary AWS services and resources to send data to Sumo 
Logic. This scenario also installs the corresponding Sumo Logic apps. 

* **Scenario 3: You use AWS security services and Sumo Logic.** You use the AWS 
security services listed under <<Specialized knowledge>> and you collect and analyze data
