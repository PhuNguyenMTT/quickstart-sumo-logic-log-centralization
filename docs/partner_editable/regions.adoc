// KEEP THIS FILE BLANK normally. By default, this file's content is excluded from the generated guide. The content about supported Regions now comes from the boilerplate (non-partner-editable) file regions_default.adoc.

// If your Quick Start requires custom info (e.g., the product is limited to a specific Region and that will not change), uncomment the custom_supported_regions attribute in the _settings.adoc file. Add the custom info here. It then appears in the generated guide instead of the boilerplate.

// Do not list all the supported Regions or provide any other info that will go out of date when new Regions are released or when services add support for more Regions.

The following table represents the Regions that are supported by the {partner-product-name} Quick Start. Customers can ingest data from any Region to any Sumo-supported Region.
