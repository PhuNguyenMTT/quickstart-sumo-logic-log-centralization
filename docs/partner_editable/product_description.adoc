Sumo Logic has apps for each AWS security service (for example, for AWS CloudTrail) that 
it supports in addition to apps that support multiple AWS services (for example, Threat 
Intel for AWS). This Quick Start deployment is for those who want to set up and configure 
the Sumo Logic console for 12 AWS services that provide security analytics. With the default settings, CloudTrail and GuardDuty apps will be deployed from this Quick Start.

Sumo Logic customers can track user activity, monitor threats, and understand how their 
security posture compares with global benchmarks. This deployment uses Virtual Private 
Cloud Flow Logs (VPC Flow Logs) and a web application firewall (AWS WAF) to monitor 
traffic patterns. Sumo Logic also uses apps to audit and maintain compliance of the 
Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) and Center for Internet 
Security (CIS). 

The included template automatically creates resources that use various AWS services to 
collect logs, which are sent to your preregistered Sumo Logic account.
