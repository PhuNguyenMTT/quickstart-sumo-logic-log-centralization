Sumo Logic is focused on continuous intelligence, a new category of software that addresses data challenges presented by digital transformations, modern applications, and cloud computing. The Sumo Logic Continuous Intelligence Platform automates the collection, ingestion, and analysis of applications, infrastructure, security, and Internet of Things (IoT) data to derive actionable insights.

Similar to security information and event management (SIEM) software, Sumo Logic uses apps to collect security events generated by AWS and other security services to provide an aggregate view of overall security and compliance posture. A Sumo Logic app is a collection of dashboards in the Sumo Logic console that provide analytics for known data streams. In minutes, you can start monitoring and troubleshooting security threats and indicators of compromise.
