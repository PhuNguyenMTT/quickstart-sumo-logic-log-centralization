You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start 
reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using the Quick Start. 

The AWS CloudFormation template for this Quick Start includes configuration parameters 
that you can customize. Some of these settings, such as instance type, affect the cost of 
deployment. For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you use. Prices 
are subject to change. 

TIP: After you deploy the Quick Start, we recommend that you enable the AWS Cost 
and Usage Report. This report delivers billing metrics to an Amazon Simple Storage 
Service (Amazon S3) bucket in your account. It provides cost estimates based on 
usage throughout each month and finalizes the data at the end of the month. For 
more information about the report, see the AWS documentation.
